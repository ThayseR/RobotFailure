Robot Execution Failures

Data Type

multivariate time series
Abstract

This dataset contains force and torque measurements on a robot after failure detection. Each failure is characterized by 15 force/torque samples collected at regular time intervals starting immediately after failure detection.

Data Characteristics

The donation includes 5 datasets, each of them defining a different learning problem:
LP1: failures in approach to grasp position
LP2: failures in transfer of a part
LP3: position of part after a transfer failure
LP4: failures in approach to ungrasp position
LP5: failures in motion with part
Feature information

All features are numeric although they are integer valued only. Each feature represents a force or a torque measured after failure detection; each failure instance is characterized in terms of 15 force/torque samples collected at regular time intervals starting immediately after failure detection; The total observation window for each failure instance was of 315 ms.

Each example is described as follows:
                 class
                 Fx1	Fy1	Fz1	Tx1	Ty1	Tz1
                 Fx2	Fy2	Fz2	Tx2	Ty2	Tz2
                 ......
                 Fx15	Fy15	Fz15	Tx15	Ty15	Tz15
where Fx1 ... Fx15 is the evolution of force Fx in the observation window, the same for Fy, Fz and the torques; there is a total of 90 features.

Feature transformation strategies

In order to improve classification accuracy, a set of five feature transformation strategies (based on statistical summary features, discrete Fourier transform, etc.) was defined and evaluated. This enabled an average improvement of 20% in accuracy. The most accessible reference is [Seabra Lopes and Camarinha-Matos, 1998].
Data Format

The data is stored in five ASCII files, with each example in the files described as follows:
                 class
                 Fx1    Fy1 Fz1 Tx1 Ty1 Tz1
                 Fx2    Fy2 Fz2 Tx2 Ty2 Tz2
                 ......
                 Fx15   Fy15    Fz15    Tx15    Ty15    Tz15
where Fx1 ... Fx15 is the evolution of force Fx in the observation window, the same for Fy, Fz and the torques; there is a total of 90 features.
